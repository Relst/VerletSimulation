# Verlet Ball Simulation

A real-time physics simulation using Verlet integration, and OpenGL rendering to simulate a rope like structure.

---
Actions:
- SpaceBar: Pause/Resume Simulation
- Click Ball Node: Toggle node position fixed status
- Drag near a node to create new node, of custom length.

TODO:
- Re-implement with Klein Enging
- Create logic for different mode operations
